Setup WiFi on your porcupine

* Hint 1: Use the Seluxit Device List app
* Hint 2: Using ssh and configuring linux


## Via Seluxit Device List

1. Download the mobile app
2. In the app, press âŠ•
3. Press "Add and configure WiFi".

Notice that your porcupine does not have an WiFi anteanna by default. But it often works OK nevertheless.

## Via `ssh`
You can configure the porcupine WiFi using ssh and configuring the WiFi directly on the porcupine.

First, `ssh` into the porcupine

```bash
ssh root@<ip> # or
ssh root@PQPI-XXXXXXX
```

Then edit `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`, e.g. via

```bash
vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
```

to have the content of the network name and password as follows:

```txt
network={
    ssid="testing"
    psk="testingPassword"
}
```

### Checks

Verify you have an ip and connection via wlan with `ip a` or `ifconfig`.

Please note: This Is this the "Standard Way" to set up WiFi with the terminal in Linux.
If there is Problem try reset the service:

```bash
systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlan0
```

or reboot the porcupine:

```bash
reboot
```
