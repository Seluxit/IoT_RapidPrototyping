      <h1>Hello Lipstick!</h1>
      <p>This is a sample wapp that should help you get started.</p>
      <p>All <i>wapps</i> are a single page, web based applications that consist of two components: <strong>'foreground data'</strong> and <strong>'background data'</strong> which serve different purposes.</p>
    </header>
    <article>
      <h2>Wapp Components</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Foreground Data</h3>
        <p>What you see here is a <i>Foreground Data</i> that is running inside the browser's tab (or in the editor's 'preview panel'). It should only contain application UI parts that require user interaction and/or functionality that doesn't need to run constantly.</p>
        <p>To create foreground application it is required to add <strong>index.html</strong> file. The rest is up to you.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Background Data</h3>
        <p>In the upper right corner of the editor, you can switch to "Background Data" that will load different files that belong to that component of an application.</p>
      </section>
      <footer>
        <p>Read <i>Help</i> to learn more about application components and how they work.</p>

      <h2>How to code?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>In order to create a wapp, use plain HTML and JavaScript or use preferred frameworks and libraries. With the current version we cannot garantee that things will work out of the box, but you can try and write to us if something goes wrong.</p>
        <p>We also recommend to read our <a href="https://developer.wappsto.com" target="_blank">documentation</a> to understand how things work and find good use for the "helper functions" we have developed for you to ease the process of retrieving and saving Wappsto data.</p>

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p class="important">In current release navigation between site pages will not work.</p>
        <!-- <a href="page.html">This link is NOT going to work</a> -->
        <p>To support navigation, use JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Adding an image</h3>
        <p>There are multiple ways you can load an image</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Image that was uploaded as a file in Wapp Creator</p>
       		<img src="icon.png" alt="Wapp icon" height="100">
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Image from external source (recommended since you will save some space)</p>
